## Metta Functions Repository

This repository contains several implementations of useful functions written in Metta, 
a multi-paradigm language for declarative and functional computations over knowledge (meta)graphs. 
Each file showcases different functionalities, such as summing even numbers, grading systems, categorizing ages, and implementing boolean logic.

# Files

1. sum_of_even_numbers_in_metta.metta
   - This metta script calculates the sum of even numbers between two given numbers.
   - Usage:
     - The function accepts two numbers and return the sum of even numbers between them.

2. grading_function_in_metta.metta
   - Implements a grading system based on numerical scores.
   - Usage:
     - The function takes a numeric score as input and returns the corresponding grade (A, B, C, etc.).

3. categorize_age_function_in_metta.metta
   - Categorizes an age into predefined groups (child, adult, senior).
   - Usage:
     - Input an age, and the function will return the appropriate category.

4. boolean_function_implementation_in_metta.metta
   - Implements basic boolean functions such as AND, OR, and NOT.
   - Boolean algebra laws or rules that are required to reduce or simplify any given complex Boolean expression.
     - Rules such as Identity law, Idempotent law, Complement law, Commutative Law ...
   - Usage:
     - These functions accept boolean values and return the result of applying the corresponding logical operation and algebra laws.

# How to Run

To run any of the files in this repository:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/BizuhanAbate/MeTTa-sample-codes.git
3. Use a Metta interpreter to execute the scripts. Each script is standalone and can be run individually based on your requirements.
